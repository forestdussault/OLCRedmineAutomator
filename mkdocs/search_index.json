Once there, login with your corporate username and password. If this is\nyour first time using Redmine, you will need to be added to the CFIA Genomics project. To get access, send an email\nto \nandrew.low@canada.ca\n, with \nadam.koziol@canada.ca\n CC'd and say you need access to the OLC Genomics project. Once you have been added to the project,\nhead to \nthe project page\n. This is where you will\nbe able to create requests.\n\n\nChanging Email Settings\n\n\nBy default, Redmine likes to send you emails about literally every issue that anybody reports, which can lead to\nreceiving far more emails than anybody has ever wanted to receive. To change this, click on the \nMy Account\n button (found\nin the top right corner when logged in to Redmine) and change the dropdown for email notifications from \nFor any event\non all my projects\n to something else - I recommend \nOnly for things I watch or I'm involved in\n. Once that's done, hit\nthe \nSave\n button on the bottom left of the screen to make sure Redmine remembers your email preferences.\n\n\nCreating Issues\n\n\nEverything in Redmine is done by creating \nIssues\n - these are requests for an analysis to be done.\n\n\nTo create a new issue, click on the \nNew Issue\n button, as shown in the below screenshot.\n\n\nClick to see screenshot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe page for new issues can be seen in the next screenshot. To have your analyses done, specific keywords are put in the\n\nSubject\n header, with any necessary details put in the \nDescription\n section. Details on what exactly needs to be put\ninto each section are under the \nData\n and \nAnalysis\n tabs for specific tools. Once an issue has been filled out, click\non the \nCreate\n button.
